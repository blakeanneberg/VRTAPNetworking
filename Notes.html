<ul>
<li>
SNMP Trap: when something happens on device, it sends message to SNMP server saying an event happened.

</ul>
<li>
Syslog: mechanism to send logs on devices to a syslog server, so the event is recorded, like plugging something into a switch to make it active.

<li>
Broadcast Domain

<ul>
<li>
Group of networked devices which all receive a layer 2 broadcast message. 

</ul>
<li>
Connecting Switches (is basically daisy chaining them together)

<ul>
<li>
Broadcast storm: clogs and overwhelms switches. So don't connect switches more than twice, or disable the port so one connection is there.

<li>
Spanning Tree Protocol: shuts down one of the links, so broadcast messages do not repeat in loop. Works with multiple switches.

<li>
SHOW SPANNING TREE

<li>
Port Aggregation (Extra bandwidth/Redundancy) via Link Aggregation Control Protocol LAC (open source) 

</ul>
<li>
VLANs

<ul>
<li>
Broadcast Domain: do not have computers on with multiple layer 3 networks connected directly/whithin one single layer 2 broadcsat domain connected with a switch (eg 10.0.0.10/24 and 172.16.0.77/24). This is becuase if one device sends out a frame with a destination MAC address of all F's, switch going to forward the frame to all the other active portson the switch except for the port where the broadcast message was received. Also switches cannot directly comuncate with multiple layer 3 networks without a router in the middle.  

<ul>
<li>
boradcast domain is a layer 2 function (all the F's in the destination MAC address is a braodcast message) that relates to a layer 3 property in that all the devices in order to work propery in a broadcast domain must have the same network portion of the address

</ul>
<li>
VLANS: Joining two networks (or broadcast domains) with a switch, you can assign ports to be a specific VLAN, creating a little mini switch within the switch, so you only forward traffic to intended devices.

<ul>
<li>
Computers on two networks, connected by two switches connect by a trunk link, tags messages in the frame to go to correct VLAN network switch, and removes the tag and gives to correct computer. 

<li>
If no IP address has been given to VLAN on a switch, there are managment networks and inter-VLAN routing on switches once trunk link is established.

</ul>
<li>
Tags in frames: VLANs create mini networks which are separate using VLAN tags in the frame as they traverse switches via a trunk link. 

<ul>
<li>
<code>en</code> 

<li>
<code>show run</code> shows config of device. Shows enabled secret, domain name and hostname and turned on SSH version 2, and securied console port and securied link vty so port 0 to 4 aso that SSH is allowed.  

<li>
<code>show vlan</code> will show all currently configured VLANs on device. VLAN1 is defualt VLAN and is default, but avoid VLAN1 use 

<li>
To configure VLANs, have to move into config mode to create the capacity for the switch to use the VLANs, so need to create a VLAN identifer betweeen 2 and 4096 and exception 2,3,4,5: <code>vlan 10</code>

<li>
Then you can give it a name: <code>name LEFT</code> for VLAN on our left.

<li>
Create a second VLAN: <code>vlan 20</code> and name <code>name RIGHT</code> 

<li>
<code>exit</code>

<li>
<code>show vlan</code> will show all the vlans

<li>
The ports on the trunk link are called Tagged Ports.

<li>
Protocol on trunk link for Tagged Ports is 802.1Q 

</ul>
<li>
Normal VLAN ID range:

<ul>
<li>
Range is 1- 1005 

<li>
1 is the dafault VLAN, but there are some dangers to using it

<li>
1002 - 1005 are reserved for legacy protocols 

</ul>
<li>
Extended VLAN ID range 

<ul>
<li>
1006 - 4096 on any given devices 

<li>
Stored in running-config

</ul>
<li>
Assigning Ports to VLANs 

<ul>
<li>
Changing vlans on the switch:  

<ul>
<li>
<code>config t</code> to show configuration on interface Fast Ethernet 0/0 

<li>
<code>do show run int f0/1</code>

<li>
Since no config, move into <code>int f0/1</code> and add configs

<li>
change it to vland 10 by <code>switchport mode access</code> changes port from trunk port to access port. 

<li>
<code>Switchport access vlan 10</code>

<li>
<code>do show vlan</code> will show all the databases

<li>
Seperate broadcast domains do not allow traffic to go from one to the other, except when there is a router, called inter-vlan routing

<li>
<code>show mac address-table dynamic</code> shows the updated vlan ports, might have to re-ping the computer to force update to the table

<li>
<code>config t</code>

<li>
<code>switchport mode access</code>

<li>
<code>switchport access vlan 10</code>

<li>
<code>int f0/4</code>

<li>
<code>switchport mode access vlan 20</code>

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Trunking Vlans 

<ul>
<li>
instead of configureing a port on two switches be a <code>access port</code> make it a  <code>trunk port</code> and specifiy what VLANs are allowed to traverse that link 

<li>
Tagged frames: When frames hit the switch port for the trunk port, the frame is modified to add a tag saying what VLAN the frame is on. The tag is removed at the other end of the trunk port, and the frame is forwared to the the specific vlan. Tagged frames are larger as they have the tag added. 

<li>
Untagged frames: on regular access ports on switches, and these are smaller as they do not have the extra tag added. 

<li>
Ways to add VLAN Trunk Protocols, as you have to tell the switch what protol you will use

<ul>
<li>
IEEE 802.1Q: Available cross platform 

<li>
Cisco Inter-Switch Link ISL: Cisco only (very old)

</ul>
<li>
Configuring the trunk link 

<ul>
<li>
dynamic trunk protocol 

<li>
Layer 2 switch ports have to be one or the other, access port or trunk port, one or the other, not both at same time. 

<li>
Ports that have not been configured are needing to be assigned a mode: <code>switchport mode</code> with either Access, Dynamic or Trunk

<li>
<code>switchport trunk allowed vlan 10,20</code> will allow to enter a list of vlan numbers that are allowed to propogate across the trunk link with a tag attached to the frame. 

<li>
see status of trunk link, <code>show interfaces trunk</code>

<li>
<code>show run int f0/24</code> will show the current config of the trunk link on swtich 1 so you can literally copy and paste it to the switch 1 config for port 24. 

<li>
<code>show int trunk</code> shows that vlan already configured. because dynamic trunk protocol automatically figured out its a trunk port, which is dangerious becuase it is not fully configured, so always manually configure the port. dont allow more access on trunk link than we actually need. 

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
adding more devices to network  

<ul>
<li>
<code>show mac address-table-dynamic</code> 

<li>
<code>show flash:</code> shows contense of flash memory of switch. <code>.bin.</code> is OS, and <code>vlan.dat</code> is vlan database,where we store <code> through 1005, and anything higher than 1005 is stored in </code>running.config` file.  

<li>
VTP mode is <code>vlan trunking protocol</code>, relates to Spanning Tree Protocol and EtherChannel`

<li>
<code>vtp mode transparent</code>: 

<li>
<code>vlan 2000</code>

<li>
give it a name <code>name extended</code>

<li>
<code>show vlan</code> will show all the vlans and <code>show run</code> shows extended vlan 2000, and is only stored in running config and is not in the vlan database. 

</ul>
<li>
Capturing Tagged frames in a network tap:  

<ul>
<li>
using wireshark, record and show in search for icmp 

<li>
When you have a trunk port, going to send and receive tagged frames.

<li>
When you have an access port, send and receive untagged frames.

</ul>
<li>
InterVLAN Routing:  

<ul>
<li>
Broadcast Domain with two switches and networks, needs a router to communicate, you can do this by configuring a switch and router. Ports on router are normal router ports, but the ports on switch need to be configured to be access ports on the switch. The connection from switch to router should be connected as a trunk link that goes up to one port on the router.  

<li>
Router on a Stick: Router has ability to turn into trunk link to read tag on frame that arrives on router, as well as add a tag to frame as it leaves the router.

<ul>
<li>
Sub interfaces that is under the main interface. So for port F0/0 is: 
<table>

</table>

</ul>
<li>
show ip int brief: shows all interfaces 

<li>
<code>no shutdown</code> makes the interface not shut down, makes router active 

<li>
need to configure sub interfaces to read the frame tag that is added into the frame, <code>int f0/0.10</code> and then choose what encapsulation to use, and on cysco its <code>dot1q</code> so its <code>encapsulation dot1Q</code> and then specify what is the expected vlan is expected to be arriving on that interface of F0/0.10 10, so its <code>encapsulation dot1Q 10.0.0.1 255.255.255.0</code> and then add <code>no shutdown</code> and then do the other interface of FastEthernet0/0.20 with <code>int f0/0.20</code> and then <code>encapsulation dot1Q 20</code>, and then <code>ip address 172.16.0.1 255.255.255.0</code> and then <code>no shut</code> and then save the config with <code>copy run start</code>

<li>

<ul>
<li>

<li>
Creating Interface VLAN 10 and Interface VLAN 20, are layer 3 interfaces and can assign IP addresses to those layer 3 interfaces. Use rollover cable plugged into the console port of layer 3 switch. 

<li>
<code>show version</code> shows what kind of switch it is. 

<li>
<code>config t</code> to configure, when a new layer 3 switch is turned on, its not initally a layer 3 switch, make it layer 3 by issueing command <code>ip routing</code>

<li>
create vlan 10 <code>int vlan 10</code>

<li>
<code>ip address 10.0.0.1 255.255.255.0</code>

<li>
<code>no shut</code> 

<li>
<code>exit</code>

<li>
create vlan 20: <code>int vlan 20</code>

<li>
<code>ip address 172.16.0.1 255.255.255.0</code> 

<li>
<code>no shut</code> 

<li>
<code>exit</code>

<li>
<code>show ip route</code> shows the network and gateway 

<li>
<code>show run</code> you can see interface set up switchport, meaning its a layer 2 port, cannot configure layer three, unless you tell the interface to be a layer3 switchport

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Troubleshooting vlans: 

<ul>
<li>
Missing VLANS on switch 1 and switch 2: <code>show vlan</code> to see what is active, and if they are not assigned to any ports you will not see anything in the <code>show int trun</code> and to add you need to go to the port <code>switchport mode access</code> and then <code>switchport access vlan10</code> and then <code>int f0/2</code> and then <code>switchport mode access vlan 20</code> and then <code>exit</code>. then configure trunk port: <code>int f0/10</code> and <code>switchport mode trunk</code> and then <code>switchport trunk allowed vlan 10,20</code> and then to verify it worked, <code>show vlan</code> to see vlan and ports, and <code>show interface trunk</code> see ports f0/10 is configured as a trunk port. When your configuring the second switch, and you do <code>show vlans</code> and not see anything excpt for defualt, and then you go into configure <code>config t</code>, <code>switchport mode trunk</code>, <code>switchport trunk allowed vlan 10,20</code>, <code>exit</code>, and then check in <code>show int trunk</code> to see what ports are assinged to what trunks, but in <code>show vlan</code> you dont see the vlans configured...just leave the vlan database blank and not add is fine, so now configure the port <code>config t</code>, int <code>g0/1</code>, <code>switchport mode trunk</code>, <code>switchport trunk allowed vlan 10,20</code>, <code>exit</code>, <code>exit</code>, and then <code>show int trunk</code>you will now see the trunk link.  

<li>
Missing VLANs on Layer 3 Switch: <code>default interface f0/1</code> to remove any preconfigured settings for the port or use <code>default interface range f0/2 - 4</code>, and <code>do show run</code> willl show all the interfaces are default.  <code>show IP route</code> will show vlans that are set. <code>show runs</code> will show commands to make the layer 3 switch behave like a layer 3 switch. <code>ip routing</code> will show all ip routes, but command <code>no ip routing</code> will clear default gateway, and nothing in the routing table, it means the layer 3 switch is currently configured to only work as a layer 2 switch, is a indication that IP routing is not enabled. to make it layer 3 switch do routing, <code>config t</code>, <code>ip routing</code>, <code>do show ip route</code>, it will show full routing. Configure g0/1 as trunk link: <code>int g0/1</code>, <code>switchport mode trunk</code> will show that the trunk enxapsulation is set to auto... so you need to do it manually, <code>switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q</code> and tells switchport not to set its encapsulation for the trunk link to auto but exclusively use the 802.1q protocol. so now you can do <code>switchport mode trunk</code> just fine, and <code>switchport trunk allowed vlan 10,20</code>, and then <code>exit</code> and do <code>show int trunk</code> to see all vlans and and ports

<li>
Issues with missing vlans: <code>show CDP neighbors</code> will shows what connections are enabled. To add a vlan to a switch: <code>config t</code>, <code>vlan 10</code>, exit, <code>do show int vlan</code> to see what is active on the trunk. But Spanning tree protocol, prevents in layer 2, STP waits 30 seconds after changes to ports to allow that port moves from unknown network topology state into one where the switch is confident about the topology and brings up the port. To add another vlan to switch, login to it, and <code>vlan 20</code>, <code>exit</code>, and wait a bit and then you will seee it on <code>show int trunk</code>. If a switch does not have any access ports on it, Trunk ports dont care if VLAN is in the database or not. If its not in the database its not going to allow that VLAN to pass traffic though the switch, but when we configure the trunk links, it doesnt automatically add VLANs to the database. But if you go into <code>config t</code> and <code>int f0/19</code> and <code>switchport mode access</code> and add a new device to a vlan 40, <code>switchport access vlan 40</code> since we are assigning a new devices to a specific access port, switch automatically creates vlan 40 in the databas and <code>switchport mode access</code> and add a new device to a vlan 40, <code>switchport access vlan 40</code> since we are assigning a new devices to a specific access port, switch automatically creates vlan 40 in the database, <code> do show vlan</code> you will see that VLAN 40 was added to database to <code>fa0/19</code>. Howver when you add VLANs to trunk links, it does automatically add VLANs to VLAN database. 

<li>
Misconfigured Trunk Ports: 

<ol>
<li>
Workstattion can ping one default gateway but not another VLAN. See the issue when you forgot to add VLANs 10 and 20 to Switch2. 

<li>
<code>show vlan</code> to see if vlans are correctly configured and assigned to correct ports.

<li>
<code>show interface trunk</code> to see if vlans 10 and 20 are allowed in that trunk link and that they are currently active in the management domain and in a spannig tree forward state. 

</ol>

APIPA Automatic Private IP Addressing: EX 169.154.0.0/16 and is developed by Microsoft and red flag as someone doesn't know what they are doing and should not be used. Or something is wrong. 

<li>
Loopback IP: Ex. 127.0.0.1 and messages sent to this never leave your computer and just a way to make sure IP is working on a workstation. |

<li>
If network portion of mask is different you will need a router/default gateway to communicate between the two computers.

Network: 10.0.0.0/8
Range: 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255
Network: 00001010 | 00000000 00000000 00000000
Broadcast: 00001010 | 11111111 11111111 11111111

<blockquote>
11111111 00000000 00000000 00000000

<p>
Lets find a host address on this network. 
Host: 00001010 00000000 00001010 00000000
</p>

<p>
Change it to a /24 network: 
10.0.10.0/24
Network: 00001010 00000000 00010010 | 00000000
Broadcast: 00001010 | 00000000 00001010 | 11111111
So this network now has 254 different hosts. Zero to 255 is 256 unique address but but remove network address which you cant apply to a device and one for the broadcast address which you cant apply to a device. 
So now the network is 10.0.10.0 - 10.0.10.255

You can always manually configure the network

<li>
SLAAC Stateless Address Auto-Configuration 

<ul>
<li>
Does not exhist in IPv4

<li>
Router in the network/default gateway, has IP address of 2001:DB8:4:A::1/64 and every so often it sends out a Router Advertisement on network 2001:DB8:4:A::/64 as a RA, so any other device can know what the network is and join. 

<li>
Depending on the operating system: 

<ul>
<li>
It will configure (Windows Random 64 bit interface identifier), so the computer will create two IPv6 (Manual IPv6 and automatically generated Link Local IPv6 address). 

<li>
Mac and Linux will use Modified EUI-64 address and take MAC address (MAC is layer 2) of network interface card, and split it in to middle of the MAC address and add FF:FE and this will make the address 64 bits long. Ex: 000C:29FF:FEFC:70A5. Then you take the first two bits and convert them into binary, Ex: 00 to 0000 0000 and then you take the 7th bit in that last and flip it to either 0 or 1, then convert it back to hexadecimal and now that becomes the interface identifier. 

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Once the router sends out the Router Advertisement, then client configures message back to rest of the network saying that the client computer is on the network now , this is my IPv6 address, and since the address is configured randomly, double check to make sure nobody else has it.

NAT is a Network Layer function (layer 3)

<li>
Router stores the source/client IP address in a table, with other parameters, and replace the source IP with that of the router, which is a public routable IP address. The packet goes to the desistination on the internet, and comes back to router which translates/swapps out address in packets in order to make those packets routable on internet.

Devices on the network

<li>
Configure devices with Community String and the IP address of the SNMP server/Manager to all for them to talk with each other. 

<li>
Management Information Base MIB: database of device properties. 

<li>
Object Identifiers OID or MIB Number: number device is programmed with, so SNMP server knows about all devices. 

<li>
SNMPv2c: community string to authenticate, read only or read write access with a community string, dangerious if compromised. Added bulk data collection mechanism. 

<li>
SNMPv3: SNMP which is encrypted, SNMP View limits amount of OID numbers,authenticates devices and provides different levels of security. Set up username of certain MIBs, encripted 

</ul>
<li>
TRAP 

<ul>
<li>
tells when a device goes down or comes back up, send message to SNMP manager saying interface went down. report that to software and report that to admin. 

</ul>
<li>
WALK the tree: 

<ul>
<li>
When configuring Observium server, manually add each device on network, and configure all devices with SNMP config info. Walk the tree is SNMP manager sends out request to all devices to send back everything to report. 

</ul>
<li>
Netflow

<ul>
<li>
Collecting info about whats happening on the devices via a snapshop.

<ul>
<li>
Source and Destination IP addresses, source and destination ports, other info in frame, packet and segment headers, and sends it to NetFlow server. 

</ul>
<li>
Good for baselining, could detetect a spike in SSH traffic on network 

</ul>
<li>
Syslog

<ul>
<li>
 Uses as much as SNMP in order to collect critical info of what happening on network

<li>
in Observium server case its acutally Observium can be syslog server and SNMP server, and alot of logging soliutions may incorprorate it, or see other centrialized logging system  

<li>
Syslog Server: requires NTP network time protocol or else does not work, so events get recoreded in correct order.   

<li>
Syslog protocol is application layer protocol when event happens on device, it sends message to syslog server, syslog server, puts message in database so human can look at it. 

<li>
Trace back events in network: Traffic Logs (how much traffic is flowing in and out similar to NetFlow), Audit Logs (who made a change, username and commands made), Syslog (stuff that happens on the device, set differnet logging levels). 

<li>
Logging Levels, programmed with OS itself, use logging levels to tell syslog server to alert Admin:

wired cable specifications and uses

<ul>
<li>
Max Bandwith is limited distancem not to mention max distance.  

<li>
Crossover cabels will still work but might have to switch cables. 

<li>
always try a different cable: damaged cable, bent pins, incorrect pinouts, incorrect cable type, open/short bent wires, bad port.  

<li>
Punch down tool and cable test are your friends.

<li>
Attenuation: when cable is too far

<li>
EMI: effecting interference from electrial equipment, espically from floresent lights. 

<li>
Crosstalk: 

<li>
Cableing issues with ethernet switch: like when computer is set to half duplex and switch is full duplex, it will not work. o

<li>
Rollover cable: Serial Port RS232 to Console Port of a router or switch, looks just like ethernet cable but is not. Sometimes is light blue.

Fiber optic operation, use two seperate fibers to send data. TX/RX Reverse is when the cords are switched, link light will not blink. 
      Transciver Mismatch: SX Transceiver and LX Transceiver will not communcate with eacher other. 

<li>
OTDR Optical Time Domain Reflectometer: able to find how many meters in is the break/fault.

<li>

Common wireless issues

<ul>
<li>
using wrong atenna like yagi for direction or a omni direction

<li>
Frequency mismatch: 5.0 GHz (better cover with alot more channels) and 2.4GHz (only three channels, even though there are 13-14 available, use cahnnel 1, 6 and 11 becase in order to get 802.11 to work correctly we need 22 MHz of space to get wireless signals to work and transfer data where you need at least 5 channels of space to do that. need each AP on a different channel. or if you have two differenet SSIDs make sure each is on its own unique channel in that particual area,)

<li>
Interference: 2.4 GHz makes water molicules spin from microwave, so use 5 GHz. are users complaining about microwaves ovens.  

<li>
Channel overlaps: use a Spectrum Analyzer tool to view each frequency.  

<li>
Wireless Coverage: In site surveys make sure you have enough coverage. 

<li>
Channels: make sure all APs are not on the same channel, put each AP on its own channel (with 2.4 you can only use 3 cahnnels)

<li>
Client Disassociation: weak signal or someother interference. See wireless controler to see what is goiung.

<li>
AP Association Time: related to Client Dissociation, show controller how long a device can connected to the network.

<li>
Channel Utilization: controler that preconfigures each AP.

<code>show mac address-table add 000c.29fc.70a5</code> and see the two ports. So on a switch you cant have the same mac address on the same VLAN on 2 different ports at the same time. so you can change the VLAN the device is on by <code>config t</code> and select port <code>int f0/3</code> and switch ports <code>switchport access vlan 50</code> but you should not have duplicate mac addresses so this is not good anyway.

</ul>
<li>
Changing VLANS 

<ul>
<li>
use the ARP table to see what devices are on the VLAN. Use in command prompt <code>arp -a</code> to see what devices are on your broadcast domain. 

<li>
<code>config t</code> 

<li>
<code>int f0/1</code>

<li>
<code>switchport access vlan 20</code>

</ul>
<li>
Speed/Duplex Mismatch: force the speed or duplex, happens on older devices, or could happen if port doesnt get reverted back to default config, when were done with the device. Device just wont link up on switch. 

<li>
Spanning Tree Protocol not enabled, connecting two switches with two links, end up getting messages that spin around, and it never stops and it will shut the switch down.

<li>
Optical Link Budget: minimun amout of light needed to make work. can be cauased by too many faults in the cord or put in patch pannel.

<li>
Collisions: hubs only, but dont happen with switches, only hubs.

<li>
Multicast: ghosting a pc, set up dozen of computers, but can overwhelm the network.

Layer 3 routing issues

<ul>
<li>
Routing Loop: How IP routing works, destination IP address of the packet needs to be the IP of the destination server/computer. Routing tables will guide the way of the frame in routers. IF router is misconfigured, can mess up traffic in routing the packet back and forth. Fixed with TTL value, time to live, in IP protocol. Command prompt error will say 'ttl expired in transit' and tracert will show a ping between the two routers. 

<li>
pinging the router will show that destination is not avilable. doing a <code>tracert -d</code> to the router willl show you where it stops. so try to SSH to the router, <code>show ip route</code> and the valuess with C is a direct connected route. if not there, add the route route, <code>config t</code> and <code>ip route 10.0.0.0 255.255.255.255.0 172.16.0.6</code> with the final IP being the router connected to the server we want to connect to. 

</ul>
<li>
DNS issues

<ul>
<li>
<code>nslookup</code>  

<li>
any address that starts with 10.somethiung is a private IP address and connect be routed. 

<li>
<code>ipconfig /flushdns</code> will flush the dns records on the local computer

</ul>
<li>
NTP and Certificate Issues

<ul>
<li>
Time: make sure the computer has correct time set.  

</ul>
<li>
Firewall Restrictions 

<ul>
<li>
If you see a computer on the <code>arp -a</code> table, and you can ping the device at 10.9 but you cant ping 10.9 to the other device 10.30? The firewall might deny all other traffice going to device, but allow all trafic from computer and back to computer. You could create inbound rule on firewall. Ports only happen in layer 4 protocols, TCP and UDP.  

<li>
BYOD challanges, users using their own device. Security, age and many issues. Or admin control over users device. 

<li>
Licensed features issues: 

<li>
Network perfromance issues.

MAC address tables of top switch will show Port example: 1 and mac address of each computer ex: DF 7B. and the Bottom switch will show Port example 1 and mac of the other computers on top switch, example: c2 a7 6e b3 3f 

<li>
Broadcast messages can be a problem, with broadcast storm with messages if all the switches are connected to each other. Spanning Tree Protocol stops these broadcast storms but not all switches have STP
    <img src="/home/blake/labsetup.png" />

<li>
<code>show mac address-table dynamic</code> or CAM table table, Content Addressable directory and show one port <code>show mac address-table interface int f0/1</code> 

<li>
KNow the IP address, find switchport: 

<ul>
<li>
no mapping on switch of IP address to switchport, as switch is layer 2 device, but all IP addresses are affilated with MAC addresses. 

<li>
find out where 10.0.0.128 is plugged into the switch, go from that local network segment (have to be on the workstation that can ping from that local segment)

<li>
look at AARP table on workstation, <code>arp -a</code>, show the mapping on the workstation of IP addresses to respective MAC addresses. 

<li>
SSH into the Switch that the workstation is connected to. <code>show mac address-table ?</code> and the ? allows you to type the address <code>mac address-table address 000c.292d.9200</code> which will show into the port. Then look at the network map and see what switch is connected to that port and SSH into that new switch, and show the mac address of the new swich <code>show mac address-table address 000c.29ed.9200</code>

<li>
<code>show cdp neighbor</code> will show all neighbors that are connected to the switch.
 nd remember that MAC address eventually get forgotten in MAC address Tables

<ul>
<li>
Swtich Memory

<ul>
<li>
Bootstrap stored in EEPROM, OS operating stored in flash memoery, startup-config is stored in virtual NVRAM, running-config is stored in RAM

<li>
Working with config and use <code>copy running-config startup-config</code> were taking copy of running-config in ram and your copying it to flash, but we dont call it startup-config, you call it config.txt

</ul>
<li>
Switch Cofiguration LAB: RS-232 Port connects computer to thw Switch via the Console Port

<ul>
<li>
Use Putty

<li>
User mode is <code>&gt;</code>

<li>
<code>en</code> is enable to privilaged mode <code>#</code>

<li>
Config mode is <code>config t</code>

<li>
Change name of switch: <code>hostname Blakeswitch1</code>

<li>
Domain Name so you can generate crypto key to enable SSH: <code>ip domain-name blake.com</code> 

<li>
Banner message of the day, for when users connect to it they can see what is going on: <code>banner motd #this is Blake's switch, stay out!#</code>

<li>
Security stuff

<ul>
<li>
create password from user mode to privilaged mode: <code>enable secret passwordcisco</code>

<li>
create username: <code>username blake scret passwordcisco</code>

<li>
generate crypto key and enable SSH: <code>crypto key generate rsa</code> 

<ul>
<li>
use at least 1024 bits 

</ul>
<li>
Change version of SSH: <code>ip ssh ver 2</code> 

<li>
Enable password encryption: <code>service password-encryption</code>

</ul>
<li>
Go to line con 0: <code>line con 0</code>

<ul>
<li>
put a password on it: <code>password passwordcisco</code> 

</ul>
<li>
Log in: <code>login</code> and exit: <code>exit</code> 

<li>
Configure switch so we can SSH into it: <code>line vty 0 4</code> 

<li>
Log into the switch with that username and password that is in the database on the router: <code>login local</code>

<li>
Only allow SSH: <code>transport input ssh</code>

<li>
Switch needs IP address for the SSH, switches do not examin IP addresses (only mac addresses in the frame and frame header, switches purpose is a layer 2 device), so IP address is just to SSH to the Switch, not route traffic. So to create a IP address, must create virtual interface: <code>interface vlan 1</code> which is a switched virtual interface SVI and has MAC address and IP address: <code>ip address 10.0.0.5 255.255.255.0</code> and <code>no shutdown</code>

<li>
VLAN 1 are just the switch ports, so they can access the virtual interface, to see current config use <code>show running-config</code>and save config <code>copy running-config startup-config</code> 

<li>
Show contense of flash memory: <code>show flash</code>

<li>
SSH into the switch:

<ul>
<li>
use putty in SSH mode, and you can ping the IP to make sure the computer can see the switch on the network.

<li>
use <code>en</code> to enter into privilaged mode

<li>
change password: <code>config t</code>

<li>
enable secret: <code>randompasswordh</code>

<li>
exit: <code>exit</code> and copy running config to startup config: <code>running-config startup-config</code> 

</ul>
<li>
Reset passowrd:  

<ul>
<li>
password is stored in file called config.txt and flash memory. access flash memory from ROMmon mode, by pressing button one button on switch while switch boots up for a hard reset wich brings you to switch, and you have to initialize flash memory with <code>flash_init</code> and look at flash memory: <code>dir flash</code> which will show the config.txt file where the password is located, but you need to rename the file to something else than <code>config.text</code> by renaming it <code>rename flash:config.text flash:config.bak</code> then boot up switch with <code>boot</code>, after it boots up use <code>en</code> for privilaged mode and do <code>show flash</code> to show files in flash memory, and rename <code>rename flash:config.bak flash:config.text</code> and now make that running config file to make it startup config file: <code> copy flash:/config.text running-config</code> now switch has running config copied over, now go into config mode and change enable secret to something you know: <code>enable secret cisco</code> and exit and <code>copy running-config startup-conf</code> 

</ul>
<li>
Upgrading the IOS

<ul>
<li>
<code>showversion</code> shows version of OS and <code>showflash</code> and shows OS that is curretly loading, OS files should end in .BIN, so change directiries by `dir flash:/c2960-lanbasek9-mx.150-2.SE6 

<li>
Size of the .BIN file is important to check free memory <code>show flash</code> 

<li>
Check integrety of the .BIN file, exactly same bits as same as router: <code>verify /md5 flash:c2960-lanbasek9-mz.150-2.se7.bin</code> runs the file though the md5 algerathm and it spits out a value and use the values to verify integrity of the file

<li>
Turn on TFTP server

<li>
Ping work station <code>pin 10.0.0.10</code>

<li>
Now copy the file <code>copy tftp flash</code> and enter address <code>10.0.0.10</code> and source file name

<li>
see if file transferd by <code>show flash</code>

<li>
Use new file for switch <code>boot system flash:/c2960-lanbasek9-mz.150-2.se7.bin</code>

<li>
exit and save <code>copy running-config startup-config</code>

<li>
reload the switch <code>reload</code> to the new .BIN file 

<li>
go back into privialge mode <code>en</code> and show version <code>show version</code>
