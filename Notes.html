<ul>
<li>
SNMP Trap: when something happens on device, it sends message to SNMP server saying an event happened.

</ul>
<li>
Syslog: mechanism to send logs on devices to a syslog server, so the event is recorded, like plugging something into a switch to make it active.

<li>
RDP: Remote Desktop Protocol, access GUI interface of headless computers.

Wireless 

<ul>
<li>
2.5 GHz for 802.11 wireless needs 22 MHz to transport data, with multiple individual channels. And can only use 3 or 4 of the 14 cannels, using 1, 6 and 11.  

<li>
5 GHz wifi spectrum ranges from 5.170 GHz to 5.835 GHz

<ul>
<li>
Some channels requires DFS, Dynamic Frequency Selection, which is used by the military, and the equipment needs to detect they are using the channels and need to automatically switch to a channel that is not a DFS channel.

<li>
Channels that done use DFS: 36, 40, 44, 48, 149, 153, 157, 161

Ethernet Switches

<ol>
<li>
Layer two switchs

<ul>
<li>
MAC address table has ports and MAC addresses connected to the port, ASIC Application-Specific Integretaged Circuit, all it does is read the destincation and source MAC address of the frames.

<li>
Swich builds circet after the MAC address table

</ul>
<li>
Layer two Broadcasts

<ul>
<li>
In the Ethernet 2 Frame, the destination MAC address field, if that is all Fs or all binary 1s, it means the frame is sent out to all active interfaces, except the receving interface 

</ul>
<li>
Broadcast Domain

<ul>
<li>
Group of networked devices which all receive a layer 2 broadcast message. 

</ul>
<li>
Connecting Switchs (is basically daisy chaining them together)

<ul>
<li>
Broadcast storm: clogs and overwhelms switches. so dont connect switches more than twice, or disable the port so one connection is there.

<li>
Spanning Tree Protocol: shuts down one of the links, so broadcast mesages do not repeat in loop. Works with multiple switches.

</ul>
<li>
VLANS

<ul>
<li>
Broadcast Domain: 

<li>
Joining two networks with a switch, you can assign ports to be a specific VLAN, creating a little mini switch within the switch, so you only forward traffic to intended devices.

<li>
Computers on two networks, connected by two switches connect by a trunk link, tags messages in the fram to go to correct VLAN network switch, and removes the tag and gives to correct computer. 

<li>
VLANS create mini networks which are seperate using VLAN tags in the fram as they travers switches via a trunk link. 

<ul>
<li>
The ports on the trunk link are called Tagged Ports.

</ul>
<li>
Protocoll on trunk link for Tagged Ports is 802.1Q 

<li>
Example seperating VOIP traffic of phone Voice VLAN from regular Data VLAN for computer data.

<li>
Putty: "show mac address-table"

<ul>
<li>
F0/0 means Fast Ethernet 

<li>
Enter configuration mode: "configure t"

Configurean command: "#int f0/3"

<li>
Change vlan port: "#switchport access vlan 20"

The secret is making sure that we use subnet mask simply to identify which portion of the IP address is the host portion, a then when we are looking to see if its network, broadcast or host address we are looking at IP address, not the subnet mask. Subnet mask is just telling us where to look in the IP address for all Zeros (network Address), all ones (Broadcast), or anything except zeros and ones (Host).

Lets find a host address on this network. 
Host: 00001010 00000000 00001010 00000000

<p>
Change it to a /24 network: 
10.0.10.0/24
Network: 00001010 00000000 00010010 | 00000000
Broadcast: 00001010 | 00000000 00001010 | 11111111
So this network now has 254 different hosts. Zero to 255 is 256 unique address but but remove network address which you cant apply to a device and one for the broadcast address which you cant apply to a device. 
So now the network is 10.0.10.0 - 10.0.10.255

You can always manually configure the network

<li>
SLAAC Stateless Address Auto-Configuration 

<ul>
<li>
Does not exhist in IPv4

<li>
Router in the network/default gateway, has IP address of 2001:DB8:4:A::1/64 and every so often it sends out a Router Advertisement on network 2001:DB8:4:A::/64 as a RA, so any other device can know what the network is and join. 

<li>
Depending on the operating system: 

<ul>
<li>
It will configure (Windows Random 64 bit interface identifier), so the computer will create two IPv6 (Manual IPv6 and automatically genererated Link Local IPv6 address). 

<li>
Mac and Linux will use Modified EUI-64 address and take MAC address (MAC is layer 2) of network interface card, and split it in to middel of the MAC address and add FF:FE and this will make the address 64 bits long. Ex: 000C:29FF:FEFC:70A5. Then you take the first two bits and convert them into binary, Ex: 00 to 0000 0000 and then you take the 7th bit in that last and flip it to either 0 or 1, then convert it back to hexadecimal and now that becomes the interface identifer. 

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Once the router sends out the Router Advertisement, then client configures message back to rest of the network saying that the client computer is on the network now , this is my IPv6 address, and since the address is configured randomly, double check to make sure nobody else has it.

Router stores the source/client IP address in a table, with other parameters, and replace the source IP with that of the router, which is a public routable IP address.

Runt: message that is too tiny, cant be processed and show up as error.

<li>
Encapsulation error: expecting non-tagged frame and it showed up as tagged frame. 

<li>
CRC Error: cyclical redundancy check that is part of the frame header itself. so the CRC algorithm pushes out a 32 bit value, attach it to the frame in the FCS field and send it. Frame could be tampered with, or looses data as it travels near a florsient lite, and then throw frame away and let other protocls figure out that the frame needs to be re-sent.

Baselining: highlights traffic, processor utilization, memory, interface 

<li>
SNMP Simple Network Management Protocol 

<ol>
<li>
Observium server uses SNMO to collect data about the devices

<li>
SNMP Manager and SNMP Agent

<ul>
<li>
Devices on the network

<li>
Configure devices with Community String and the IP address of the SNMP server/Manager to all for them to talk with each other. 

<li>
Management Information Base MIB: database of device properties. 

<li>
Object Identifiers OID or MIB Number: number device is programmed with, so SNMP server knows about all devices. 

<li>
SNMPv2c: community string to authenticate, read only or read write access with a community string, dangerious if compromised. Added bulk data collection mechanism. 

<li>
SNMPv3: SNMP which is encrypted, SNMP View limits amount of OID numbers,authenticates devices and provides different levels of security. Set up username of certain MIBs, encripted 

</ul>
<li>
TRAP 

<ul>
<li>
tells when a device goes down or comes back up, send message to SNMP manager saying interface went down. report that to software and report that to admin. 

</ul>
<li>
WALK the tree: 

<ul>
<li>
When configuring Observium server, manually add each device on network, and configure all devices with SNMP config info. Walk the tree is SNMP manager sends out request to all devices to send back everything to report. 

</ul>
<li>
Netflow

<ul>
<li>
Collecting info about whats happening on the devices via a snapshop.

<ul>
<li>
Source and Destination IP addresses, source and destination ports, other info in frame, packet and segment headers, and sends it to NetFlow server. 

</ul>
<li>
Good for baselining, could detetect a spike in SSH traffic on network 

</ul>
<li>
Syslog

<ul>
<li>
 Uses as much as SNMP in order to collect critical info of what happening on network

<li>
in Observium server case its acutally Observium can be syslog server and SNMP server, and alot of logging soliutions may incorprorate it, or see other centrialized logging system  

<li>
Syslog Server: requires NTP network time protocol or else does not work, so events get recoreded in correct order.   

<li>
Syslog protocol is application layer protocol when event happens on device, it sends message to syslog server, syslog server, puts message in database so human can look at it. 

<li>
Trace back events in network: Traffic Logs (how much traffic is flowing in and out similar to NetFlow), Audit Logs (who made a change, username and commands made), Syslog (stuff that happens on the device, set differnet logging levels). 

<li>
Logging Levels, programmed with OS itself, use logging levels to tell syslog server to alert Admin:

load balancer: distributes data to multiple differnet servers running the same service, redierect traffic. 

<li>
Using multiple load balancers: if one fails or needs software upgrade, still have other load balancer operating

<li>
Load Balancers need to be connected to switches and connected to servers. Servers need to be connected to two loadbalancers each, using NIC teaming (network interface card), and need layer three switches or routers and those need to be redundant (maybe 4) via multipathing (via routing protocols, load balances, layer 2 protocols), multipule paths to data center.
